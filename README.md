# Humanify
> Un-minify Javascript code using ChatGPT

This tool uses ChatGPT and other tools to un-minify Javascript code. Note that
ChatGPT does not perform any structural changes â€“ it only provides hints to
rename variables and functions. The heavy lifting is done by Babel on AST level.

## Example

Given the following minified code:

```javascript
function a(e,t){var n=[];var r=e.length;var i=0;for(;i<r;i+=t){if(i+t<r){n.push(e.substring(i,i+t))}else{n.push(e.substring(i,r))}}return n}
```

The tool will output a human-readable version:

```javascript
function splitString(inputString, chunkSize) {
  var chunks = [];
  var stringLength = inputString.length;
  var startIndex = 0;
  for (; startIndex < stringLength; startIndex += chunkSize) {
    if (startIndex + chunkSize < stringLength) {
      chunks.push(inputString.substring(startIndex, startIndex + chunkSize));
    } else {
      chunks.push(inputString.substring(startIndex, stringLength));
    }
  }
  return chunks;
}
```

This tool is considered experimental and has varying performance with long JS
files. Long files may take a long time to process and will burn some money from
your OpenAI account depending on the size of the file.

## Getting started

First install the dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Next up you'll need a ChatGPT API key. You can get one by signing up at
https://openai.com/.

There are several ways to provide the API key to the tool:
```shell
echo "OPENAI_TOKEN=your-token" > .env && npm start -- minified-file.js
export OPENAI_TOKEN="your-token" && npm start -- minified-file.js
OPENAI_TOKEN=your-token npm start -- minified-file.js
npm start -- --key="your-token" minified-file.js
```

Use your preferred way to provide the API key. Use `npm start -- --help` to see
all available options.

## Features

The main features of the tool are:
* Uses ChatGPT functions to get smart suggestions to rename variable and
  function names
* Uses custom and off-the-shelf Babel plugins to perform AST-level unmanging
