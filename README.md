# Humanify
> Deobfuscate Javascript code using LLMs ("AI")

This tool uses large language modeles (like ChatGPT & llama2) and other tools to
deobfuscate, unminify, transpile, decompile and unpack Javascript code. Note
that LLMs don't perform any structural changes ‚Äì they only provide hints to
rename variables and functions. The heavy lifting is done by Babel on AST level
to ensure code stays 1-1 equivalent.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Check out the [introduction blog post][blogpost] for in-depth explanation!

## Example

Given the following minified code:

```javascript
function a(e,t){var n=[];var r=e.length;var i=0;for(;i<r;i+=t){if(i+t<r){n.push(e.substring(i,i+t))}else{n.push(e.substring(i,r))}}return n}
```

The tool will output a human-readable version:

```javascript
function splitString(inputString, chunkSize) {
  var chunks = [];
  var stringLength = inputString.length;
  var startIndex = 0;
  for (; startIndex < stringLength; startIndex += chunkSize) {
    if (startIndex + chunkSize < stringLength) {
      chunks.push(inputString.substring(startIndex, startIndex + chunkSize));
    } else {
      chunks.push(inputString.substring(startIndex, stringLength));
    }
  }
  return chunks;
}
```

üö® **NOTE:** üö®

Large files may take some time to process and use a lot of tokens if you use
ChatGPT. For a rough estimate, the tool takes about 2 tokens per character to
process a file:

```shell
echo "$((2 * $(wc -c < yourscript.min.js)))"
```

So for refrence: a minified `bootstrap.min.js` would take about $0.5 to
un-minify using ChatGPT.

## Getting started

You'll need to decide whether to use ChatGPT or llama2. In a nutshell:

* ChatGPT
  * Runs on someone else's computer that's specifically optimized for this kind
    of things
  * Costs money depending on the length of your code
  * Is more accurate
  * Is (probably) faster

See instructions below for each option:

### ChatGPT

You'll need a ChatGPT API key. You can get one by signing up at
https://openai.com/.

There are several ways to provide the API key to the tool:
```shell
OPENAI_TOKEN=your-token bunx @hikae/humanify -o deobfuscated.js obfuscated-file.js

bunx @hikae/humanify --key="your-token" -o deobfuscated.js obfuscated-file.js
```

Use your preferred way to provide the API key. Use `bunx @hikae/humanify --help` to see
all available options.

## Features

The main features of the tool are:
* Uses ChatGPT functions to get smart suggestions to rename variable and
  function names
* Uses custom and off-the-shelf Babel plugins to perform AST-level unmanging
* Uses Webcrack to unbundle Webpack bundles
